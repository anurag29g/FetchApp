Fetch Take-Home App

Technical Details - 
Frameworks: SwiftUI, Core Data
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Core Data: Used for local persistence, allowing the app to store and retrieve data even when offline.
Concurrency: Uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to fetch and store data asynchronously, providing a smooth, responsive UI.

Project Structure
1. Models
Item: Represents each data item with properties id, listId, and name.
CachedItem: Core Data entity that mirrors the Item model to store items locally.
2. View Models
ItemViewModel: Manages data-fetching, sorting, and grouping logic. Communicates with Core Data to save and retrieve items.
3. Views
ContentView: Main view displaying grouped items with support for pull-to-refresh and dropdown grouping.
ListSectionView: Displays individual listId sections with items sorted by name within each section.

I chose to utilize Core Data to provide offline access and persistence. 
Once data is fetched from the API, it's saved locally. 
If the app is restarted or thereâ€™s no internet connection, data is loaded directly from Core Data, enhancing user experience by reducing dependency on the network.

Notes for Recruiters
This project demonstrates proficiency in iOS development, particularly with:

Data Persistence: Using Core Data for local storage.
Efficient Data Handling: Grouping, sorting, and filtering.
UI Responsiveness: Asynchronous data fetching and smooth UI updates.
Thank you for reviewing my app! I hope it demonstrates my commitment to building high-quality, efficient applications for iOS.
